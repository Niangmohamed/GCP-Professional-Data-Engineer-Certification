# GCP Professional Data Engineer Certification

A Professional Data Engineer enables data-driven decision making by collecting, transforming, and publishing data. A data engineer should be able to design, build, operationalize, secure, and monitor data processing systems with a particular emphasis on security and compliance; scalability and efficiency; reliability and fidelity; and flexibility and portability. A Data Engineer should also be able to leverage, deploy, and continuously train pre-existing machine learning models.

The Professional Data Engineer exam assesses your ability to:

1. Design data processing systems

2. Build and operationalize data processing systems

3. Operationalize machine learning models

4. Ensure solution quality
